    <h2 id="about">About her</h2>
    <p>Solána Imani Rowe (born November 8, 1989), known professionally as SZA (/ˈsɪzə/ ⓘ SIZ-ə), is an American singer-songwriter. SZA first garnered attention with her self-released extended plays (EPs) See.SZA.Run (2012) and S (2013), leading to her becoming the first female artist signed to Top Dawg Entertainment. Her third EP, Z (2014), was her first project released to digital retailers and reached the top ten on the US Independent Albums chart. After signing a joint recording deal with RCA Records, SZA released her debut studio album, Ctrl (2017), to critical and commercial success. The album earned four Grammy Award nominations and became the second longest-charting R&B album by a female artist on the US Billboard 200. The following year, her Kendrick Lamar collaboration "All the Stars"—a top-ten single in both the US and UK—earned her Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song. Her feature on Doja Cat's "Kiss Me More" set a record as the longest-running all-female collaboration in the US top-ten and won SZA her first Grammy award. In 2022, SZA released her second studio album, SOS (2022). It spent twelve weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, and it set a record for the largest streaming week for an R&B album in the US. SOS was supported by five top-10 singles, including her first US number-one "Kill Bill" (2023). She earned her second chart-topping song that same year, with a guest feature on Drake's "Slime You Out". A deluxe reissue for SOS, titled Lana, was released in 2024 after a long series of delays. Venturing outside of music, she made an acting debut in the female buddy comedy film One of Them Days (2025). SZA has earned numerous accolades throughout her career, including five Grammy Awards, a Brit Award, an American Music Award, a Guild of Music Supervisors Award, and two Billboard Women in Music awards, including Woman of the Year. She has co-written songs for artists such as Nicki Minaj, Beyoncé, Travis Scott, ScHoolboy Q, and Rihanna. In 2024, she received the Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.</p>

    <p>While working on her fourth EP, A, which would later become her debut album, SZA began writing songs for other artists, including Nicki Minaj's "Feeling Myself" and Travis Scott's "Ok Alright." She also co-wrote "Consideration" for Rihanna’s 2016 album Anti, alongside Rihanna and Tyran Donaldson. In addition to her role as a songwriter, she was featured on the track and later performed it live with Rihanna at the 2016 Brit Awards. Around this time, she collaborated with several of her labelmates on various projects, including Ab-Soul on "Lonely Soul/The Law (Prelude)," ScHoolboy Q on "Neva Change," Isaiah Rashad on "Stuck in the Mud," and Kendrick Lamar on "Untitled 04 | 08.14.2014."

        After signing with RCA Records in April 2017, SZA released her debut studio album, Ctrl, on June 9. Originally slated for release in 2015, the album faced multiple delays due to disagreements between SZA and Top Dawg Entertainment executives. Struggling with perfectionism and track selection, she grew frustrated with the process, even stating in 2016 that she was considering quitting music and allowing TDE president Punch to release the album on her behalf. In mid-2017, an unknown person took the hard drive containing the album's music.
        
        Described as an R&B album with elements of jazz and alternative music, Ctrl received universal acclaim from critics and earned a score of 86 on Metacritic. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, with 125,000 album-equivalent units. The album produced five singles: "Drew Barrymore," "Love Galore," "The Weekend," "Broken Clocks," and "Garden (Say It Like Dat)," all of which have been certified Double Platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). "TwoAM," initially released as a standalone single in 2016, was later included in the deluxe edition of the album. Ctrl was ranked among the best albums of 2017 by numerous critics and was named the best of the year by Time, New York Daily News, and Vice. Between August 2017 and February 2018, SZA promoted the album with a North American and Oceanic concert tour of more than fifty shows. She also opened for the European leg of Bryson Tiller’s Set It Off Tour in support of his album True to Self from October to November 2017.
        
        In August 2017, SZA collaborated with Maroon 5 on "What Lovers Do," from their album Red Pill Blues. The song peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, marking her first top-ten hit. The following month, she released "Quicksand" for the second soundtrack of HBO’s Insecure. Around the same time, she joined Khalid and Post Malone for a remix of Lorde’s "Homemade Dynamite" from her album Melodrama. In October, she began working on a joint album project with Mark Ronson and Tame Impala. In November 2017, SZA received five Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist, making her the most-nominated female artist at the 2018 Grammy Awards. Despite the multiple nominations, she did not win in any category.
        
        In January 2018, SZA collaborated with Kendrick Lamar on "All the Stars," the lead single from the Black Panther soundtrack. The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her second top-ten hit after "What Lovers Do." In April, she worked with Cardi B on "I Do," which appeared on Cardi B’s debut album, Invasion of Privacy.
